Thank you for reviewing my project. 

The CodeBook.md R markdown document will exlain how my script works to achieve the tidy data sets - one being an extracted data set for each observation in the experiment, when the other being a summary data set with the average of each variable available in the extracted data set. 

You can also review my script using the run_analysis.R file.
